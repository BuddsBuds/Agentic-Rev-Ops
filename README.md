# Agentic Revenue Operations System

A sophisticated autonomous revenue operations system using a Queen-based swarm architecture with majority voting rules.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Queen Agent

2. **Marketing Agent** - Campaign automation, lead nurturing
3. **Analytics Agent** - Data analysis, forecasting, anomaly detection

### Majority Voting System
