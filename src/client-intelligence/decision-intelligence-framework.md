# Decision Intelligence Framework

## Overview

The Decision Intelligence Framework transforms raw client intelligence into actionable recommendations through context-aware analysis, predictive modeling, and personalized delivery. This system ensures every recommendation is grounded in deep client understanding, market reality, and proven success patterns.
